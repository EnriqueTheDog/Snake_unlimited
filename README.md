# 🐍 Snake Unlimited!

This is a game I made for practising Python--It's also my first Python project! After spending some days studying Python, I decided to start by a simple, well-known learning proyect. It took me several hours to complete it, and it helped me a lot to get comfortable with Python basics, and also to learn about the pygame library.
